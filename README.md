# fe-base
A basic frontend application template to be used for applications, containing a babel.config, package.json, postcss.config.js, tsconfig.json, and webpack.config.js files with common configuration and/or packages that every application is likely to use.

# Requirements

You'll need to have node and npm installed. We highly recommend you use [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installation-and-update) in order to manage your local node and npm versions.

Once you have `nvm` installed, you can run

```
nvm install node
```

To install the latest version of node and npm.
